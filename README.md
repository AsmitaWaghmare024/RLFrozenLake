# RLFrozenLake
# FrozenLake Q-Learning Agent

Project Description

This project demonstrates how to train a Q-learning agent to navigate the Frozen Lake environment using the gymnasium library. The environment is an 8x8 grid where the agent must find the optimal path to reach a goal while avoiding holes. This project provides a complete setup and implementation guide for running the Q-learning algorithm on the Frozen Lake environment, visualizing the agent's path, and understanding the reward structure.
